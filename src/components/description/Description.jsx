                </h3>

                <p>
                    By combining two sources, we provide users with more relevant, insightful, and contextually rich answers.
                    User Query Input: Users enter their search queries or requests into the intuitive search bar.
                    Source-Specific Responses: Each of the two sources independently generates responses based on the user's query, drawing from their expertise and content.
                    Cross-Source Fusion: Here's where the magic happens. We seamlessly blend the responses from both sources, for each source, creating a unified and comprehensive result that incorporates the insights and information from both sources.
